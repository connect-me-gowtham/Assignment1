#Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
#Problem Statement: Write a Python program that does the following:
#1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
#2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
#o	Addition
#o	Subtraction
#o	Multiplication
#o	Division

A = int(input("Enter the First Number: "))
B = int(input("Enter the Second Number: "))
Addition = (A+B)
print("Addition:", Addition)
Subtraction = (A-B)
print("Subtraction:", Subtraction)
Multiplication = (A*B)
print("Multiplication:", Multiplication)
Division = (A/B)
print("Division:", Division)
